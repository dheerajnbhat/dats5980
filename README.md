## Towards Reliable Commonsense Reasoning in Small Language Models

This repository contains research code, datasets, and experiments for exploring and improving commonsense reasoning capabilities in small language models (SmolVLMs). The project focuses on augmenting visual question answering (VQA) and commonsense reasoning tasks with external knowledge, knowledge graphs, and prompt engineering to enhance reliability and performance.

### Project Structure

- `a-okvqa/` — Experiments, scripts, and notebooks for the A-OKVQA dataset, including model evaluation, knowledge augmentation, and visual grounding.
- `commonsenseqa/` — Notebooks and scripts for the CommonsenseQA dataset, including knowledge graph construction and semantic relation extraction.
- `conceptnet/` — Additional resources and experiments with ConceptNet.
- `colab notebooks/` — Benchmarking and exploratory notebooks for various models and datasets.

### Key Features

- Visual question answering with knowledge augmentation
- Commonsense reasoning experiments with small language models
- Integration of ConceptNet and other external knowledge sources
- Prompt engineering for improved model reliability
- Benchmarking and evaluation scripts
